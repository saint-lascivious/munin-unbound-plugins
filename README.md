## Help! My graphs aren't showing up!

* Be patient

Graphs should be generated at five minute intervals. If you still do not see graphs after this time, try restarting the machine and waiting a further five minutes. If you still can not get any graphs to display, contact me for further support.

## Configuration

The default configuration should Just Work. If you have a non-standard configuration, you can do one of the following.

* Edit the existing `plugins.conf` file

* Sample setup for '/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/plugins.conf':
```
[unbound*]
    user root
    env.unbound_conf /etc/unbound/unbound.conf
    env.unbound_control /usr/sbin/unbound-control
    env.spoof_warn 100
    env.spoof_crit 1000
```

* Download and edit a sample `plugins.conf` file from this repo:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/munin-unbound-plugins/master/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/plugins.conf -q -O - | sudo tee /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/plugins.conf
```
